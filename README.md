# Leptopy: Python bindings for Leptonica

This is a modern and comprehensive set of Python bindings for Leptonica, spun off from
OCRmyPDF and released under a BSD-2-Clause license like Leptonica itself.

Leptonica is an image processing library geared towards scanned image processing,
document processing, binary morphology and OCR.

CFFI is used instead of ctypes. The regularity and consistent design of Leptonica is
exploited to create bindings efficiently.

Python 3.6+ is required.
